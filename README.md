# @majobot/bot
---
This is just a simple reference implementation of the bot interface provided in [@majobot/api](https://github.com/majobot/api).

### Purpose
The ```Bot``` interface is just used as a kind of facade for the ```PlatformClient``` management.
So an implementation features relatively small functionality, since the commands are the part which brings in the action.
